## Selling our tokens

## Listing marketplace tokens

## Buying tokens from the marketplace

## Other features
There's still some missing functionality on this DApp that would be great to build, and probably make sense to include, such as: Allow the user to cancel sales, to tranfer tokens to other addresses, trading tokens offchain (maybe through Whisper?), etc. This tutorial covers most of the patterns required to implement them, so if you're looking for an extra challenge, you can have fun building these!
