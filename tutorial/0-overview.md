# Creating a custom ERC721 marketplace DApp

## Intro
In this tutorial series, we'll explore how can we use Embark to simplify the development of DApps. We will use the EmbarkJS to store image files in IPFS, and create the required functionality to interact with contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain.

In order for us to focus on these two aspects of DApp development, the code for the frontend is already created, and can be downloaded from our [repository](https://github.com/status-im/status-dapp-workshop-mexico). This DApp uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), so knowledge of framework will be helpful for completing this tutorial, but it's not 100% required.

The Dapp we will build is an [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) Marketplace that will allow us to mint non fungible tokens, to buy and sell them.
